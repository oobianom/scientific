## Installation

You can install the last available released version from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tufte)

``` r
install.packages('tufte')
```

You can also install the development version of **tufte** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rstudio/tufte")
```

## Usage

The easiest way to make a new R Markdown document using Tufte style is from within RStudio. Go to _File > New File > R Markdown > From template > Tufte Handout_.

This can also be created from the command line using

```r
rmarkdown::draft("tufte.Rmd", "tufte_html", "tufte")
```

## Getting help

There are two main places to get help:

1. The [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/c/r-markdown/10) is a friendly place to ask any questions about rmarkdown and the R Markdown family of packages. Use tag **tufte** in your post.

1. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r-markdown+tufte) is a great source of answers to common rmarkdown questions. It is also a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible example that illustrates your problem.
